"Data Engineer","Why we exist:
The Indian internet has exploded. Over half a billion Indians will be online before the end of this year. Most of these Indians will prefer using their own language online. And next to nobody is building solutions for them. They are prevented from using the internet to its fullest potential because English forms a language barrier.

Whenever they visit a site or app, they are met with a wall of text in a language that they do not understand.

We at Reverie believe in language equality on the internet. It’s what drives us and gives what we do meaning. Language equality basically means that every Indian should enjoy the same range of options and experiences online in their own language that an English speaker does online.

What we do:
We take immense pride in the fact that we tackle some of the most complex and impactful problems Indian language users currently face today.

We’re working towards our mission of language equality by building a full-stack of language technologies and solutions, spanning fonts, font rendering, transliteration, translation, app & website localisation in real-time, Indian language input (check out our Swalekh keypad on the App Store), Indian language voice assistants, and Indic search, to empower the Indian language user and let them tap into the possibilities the internet offers them.

What we DON’T care about:
Your age, gender, where you went to college, or your academic scores.

What we DO care about:
Our mission resonates with you
You have an insatiable curiosity, which means you’ll figure a way out even in an unfamiliar environment.

Broad range of business and IT experiences; Has achieved technical and/or business certification(s).
Skills/Competencies:

Communication: Data scientists must communicate effectively up and down the data supply chain: first, to obtain access to the data they require; second, to work with those who understand the business meaning behind the data; and third, to articulate findings and implications to business leaders in language they understand. A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.

Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.

Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.

Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.

Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.

Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.

Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.

Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.

Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.

Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.

Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.

Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.

Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

Ability to formulate hypotheses, draw conclusions and deliver results

PharmEasy was founded in 2015 with the sole purpose to make healthcare easily available, accessible and affordable to all through the extensive use of new-age cutting-edge technology. Today, we are one of India's largest healthcare aggregators connecting lakhs of patients to licensed pharmacies & diagnostic centres online for all their medical needs. We are particularly catering to the chronic-care segment, and offer a range of services including medicine delivery, tele-consultation, sample collection for diagnostic tests as well as subscription-based services for all these categories.

Our highly efficient and technology led Consumer and Supply-chain platforms ensure that medicines are delivered from a licensed pharmacy within six hours of the validation of prescriptions submitted by our customers. And such customer promises are improving with the increasing scale of our business, and continuous product innovation.

By extensively leveraging the latest in hardware and software technology, we are also committed to eradicate fake medicines from the Pharma ecosystem that contribute to roughly 30% of drug volumes in India. Our product innovations have allowed for complete data transparency in the entire Pharma supply-chain to empower even the end-users to validate the authenticity and genuineness of the medicines for every medicine sold, using constructs such as unique barcoding of information like expiry dates, origination of drugs etc.

With our scalable technology and processes, we are now reliably delivering healthcare services and medicines to every single pin code in the country.
